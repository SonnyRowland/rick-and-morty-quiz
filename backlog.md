------- MENTION/ What I would've done differently ---------

# API DATA ISSUES

my brother was getting annoyed when he felt like the questions had multiple answers. If he's right (he might not be), the data is incomplete.

# REPEATED CHARACTERS IN API ENDPOINTS

maybe it's some quirk of the show but it appears that there are repeated characters (with different images), if i had a bit more time I would have guarded against this
